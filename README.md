# 🛡️ Online Payment Fraud Detection

## 📖 Overview
Online Payment Fraud Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and prevent fraudulent online transactions. It analyzes user behavior, transaction history, and payment patterns to detect unusual or suspicious activities in real time. The goal is to ensure secure, reliable, and trustworthy digital payments.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time fraud detection  
- Machine Learning–based classification  
- Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Model training and performance evaluation  
- Visualization of fraud patterns  
- Secure and scalable implementation  

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- (Optional: Flask / Streamlit for web deployment)

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Algorithms
The system can use any of the following algorithms:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Neural Network  

Each model is trained on a labeled dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

## 📊 Dataset
You can use public datasets such as:
- [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
Ensure proper preprocessing before model training (normalization, scaling, handling class imbalance, etc.).
